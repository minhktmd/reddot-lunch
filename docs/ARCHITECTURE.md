## Overview

Dat Com RDL is a full-stack Next.js application. Both frontend and backend live in the same repository and are deployed together on Vercel. There is no separate backend service.

## Full-Stack in Next.js App Router

### How backend code is organized

Next.js API routes (`src/app/api/`) act as the backend. They are thin handlers — parse, validate, delegate, respond:

```ts
// src/app/api/orders/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json()
  const result = createOrderSchema.safeParse(body)
  if (!result.success) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: result.error }, { status: 400 })
  }
  const order = await createOrder(result.data)  // business logic in service
  return NextResponse.json(order)
}
```

Business logic is never written inside route handlers. It lives in:

| Layer | Location | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Route handler | `src/app/api/` | Parse request, validate input, call service, return response |
| Feature service | `src/features/*/services/` | Business logic specific to one feature |
| Domain service | `src/domains/*/services/` | Business logic shared across multiple features |
| Shared lib | `src/shared/lib/` | External integrations: Prisma, Slack |

### Why not a separate backend?

- Office tool with ~30–50 users — no scale requirement justifying the complexity
- All infrastructure on free tier — Vercel hosts both frontend and API
- Prisma runs fine in Next.js serverless functions
- Simpler deployment: one repo, one build, one deploy

## Database — Prisma Postgres via Prisma Accelerate

### Why Prisma

- Type-safe queries — no raw SQL, no runtime type mismatches
- Schema-first — `schema.prisma` is the single source of truth for the DB structure
- Migration history — `prisma migrate` tracks schema changes over time
- Prisma Studio — visual DB browser for debugging

### Prisma client singleton

Next.js dev server hot-reloads frequently, which would create multiple `PrismaClient` instances and exhaust DB connections. The singleton pattern prevents this:

```ts
// src/shared/lib/prisma.ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"
import { withAccelerate } from "@prisma/extension-accelerate"

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
  prisma: ReturnType<typeof makePrisma> | undefined
}

function makePrisma() {
  return new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate())
}

export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? makePrisma()

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma
```

Always import `prisma` from `@/shared/lib/prisma` — never instantiate `PrismaClient` elsewhere. Prisma Postgres requires the `withAccelerate()` extension — never create a bare `PrismaClient` without it.

### Why Prisma Postgres

- No cold start — eliminates the 3–4s latency that plagued the previous Supabase free tier setup
- Same platform as Prisma ORM — seamless integration via `DATABASE_URL`
- Optimized for serverless — built-in connection pooling via Prisma Accelerate

---

## Timezone Strategy

All "today" logic uses **Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh (UTC+7)**. This is the most error-prone area of the codebase.

### The problem

`new Date()` in a Vercel serverless function returns UTC time. At 23:00 UTC, it is already 06:00 the next day in Ho Chi Minh City. Without timezone handling, "today's menu" would return the wrong day for 7 hours every night.

### The solution

`MenuOfDay.date` is always stored as `00:00:00 UTC` representing midnight Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh of that calendar day. All date boundary queries use the helpers in `src/domains/menu/lib/date.ts`:

```ts
// Always use these — never raw new Date()
getTodayUTC()            // today's date key for DB storage/query
parseDateParam(str)      // parse YYYY-MM-DD route param for DB query
```

### Why store as UTC midnight of the local day?

Storing `2026-04-04T00:00:00+07:00` as `2026-04-03T17:00:00Z` in the DB allows simple `@unique` on the `date` field and straightforward equality queries without timezone conversion at query time.

## Admin Access — Token-Based Protection

### Why not full authentication

- Internal office tool — the URL is not publicly shared
- Replacing a Google Sheet — no auth existed before
- 30–50 known users in the same office
- Full auth (session management, login flow, protected routes) would add significant complexity for marginal security gain at this scale

However, with the addition of the **Lunch Fund** (real money in the system), leaving `/admin/*` completely open is no longer acceptable. Any employee could accidentally or intentionally create ledger entries, adjust balances, or view financial data.

### Solution: shared admin token via cookie

A single `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable acts as the shared secret for all admin access. The token is distributed out-of-band (e.g. via Slack DM to admin employees).

**Flow:**

1. Admin visits `/admin?token=<ADMIN_TOKEN>` once (e.g. from a Slack message or bookmarked link)
2. Next.js middleware validates `?token` against `ADMIN_TOKEN` env var
3. On match: set `HttpOnly` cookie `admin_token=<value>`, redirect to `/admin` (clean URL)
4. All subsequent requests to `/admin/*`: middleware reads cookie → valid → allow through
5. Cookie miss or mismatch → redirect to `/admin/login` (simple page with a token input field)

**Cookie settings:**
- `HttpOnly: true` — not readable by JavaScript
- `SameSite: Strict` — no cross-site leakage
- `Max-Age: 30 days` — survives tab closes; admin re-enters token after 30 days
- `Secure: true` in production (HTTPS only)
- `Path: /admin` — cookie sent only to `/admin/*` routes

**Token rotation:** change `ADMIN_TOKEN` env var → redeploy → all existing cookies become invalid → admin re-enters new token link.

### What this protects

- All `/admin/*` pages: dashboard, menu management, employee management, finance, settings

### What this does NOT protect

- Employee identity on `/` — still no auth; anyone can select any name (unchanged)
- API routes — `/api/*` remains open; the token middleware applies only to `/admin/*` page routes
- The `?token=` URL in browser history — admin should use private/incognito if on a shared device

### Implementation

- `src/middleware.ts` — Next.js middleware, matches `/admin/:path*`
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` env var — set in Vercel dashboard and `.env.local`
- `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx` — shown on cookie miss; has a token input field that triggers the `?token=` flow client-side
- No DB changes required — token lives entirely in env + cookie

### Identity (unchanged)

Users identify themselves by selecting their name from a dropdown. The selected `employeeId` is saved to `localStorage`. This is not secure — anyone can impersonate anyone — but it is sufficient for the employee use case.

`role = "admin"` is still used only to route Slack notifications to the right people. It does not replace the cookie-based admin gate.

## Pre-publish Menu Pattern

### The problem

If the system auto-cloned the previous day's menu into the DB every morning, it would create orphaned records on weekends, holidays, or days when the restaurant is closed.

### The solution

Nothing is written to the DB until admin clicks "Đăng thực đơn". Until then:

1. `GET /api/menu/today` checks if a `MenuOfDay` exists for today
2. If not → queries the most recent previous `MenuOfDay` and returns its items as `prefill`
3. The UI renders the prefill items as an editable draft (Zustand store — `useMenuDraftStore`)
4. `POST /api/menu/publish` creates `MenuOfDay` + all `MenuOfDayItem` records atomically

This means: if admin never publishes, no DB record is ever created for that day.

### Why atomic publish

The publish operation does several things at once (create menu, create auto orders, send Slack). Using a Prisma transaction for the DB writes ensures consistency — if auto order creation fails, the menu is not left in a half-published state:

```ts
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  const menu = await tx.menuOfDay.create({ ... })
  await tx.menuOfDayItem.createMany({ ... })
  await tx.order.createMany({ ... })  // auto orders
})
// Slack is called AFTER the transaction — failures don't roll back DB
```

---

## Slack Integration

### Two mechanisms

| Mechanism | Used for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Incoming Webhook | Channel posts | Simpler — no bot setup, just a URL |
| Bot API (`chat.postMessage`) | Direct messages | Webhooks cannot send DMs |

### Failure isolation

Slack calls are always outside DB transactions and always use `Promise.allSettled` for fan-out DMs:

```ts
// After DB transaction succeeds:
await Promise.allSettled(
  employees.map(e => e.slackId ? postDM(e.slackId, message) : Promise.resolve())
)
```

If Slack is down or a DM fails, the publish operation still succeeds. Slack errors are logged with `logger.error` but never surfaced to the user as a failure.

### Why `Promise.allSettled` not `Promise.all`

`Promise.all` rejects immediately if any DM fails — one bad `slackId` would silently skip all remaining DMs. `Promise.allSettled` sends all DMs regardless of individual failures.

## VietQR — Dynamic Payment QR Code

### Pattern

QR codes for bank transfers are generated entirely client-side using the VietQR public image API. No file storage, no server involvement.

```ts
// src/shared/utils/viet-qr.ts
export function buildVietQRUrl(params: VietQRParams): string {
  const { bankCode, bankAccount, bankAccountName, amount, addInfo } = params
  const base = `https://img.vietqr.io/image/${bankCode}-${bankAccount}-compact2.png`
  const query = new URLSearchParams({
    amount: String(amount),
    addInfo,
    accountName: bankAccountName,
  })
  return `${base}?${query.toString()}`
}
```

The `<img src={vietQRUrl}>` tag fetches the rendered QR image directly from VietQR's CDN. The server is never involved.

### Why client-side

The VietQR image URL fully encodes all parameters — amount, account number, transfer description. There is nothing for the server to do. This also means no file storage is needed — previously Vercel Blob was used for a static QR image, but that approach required admin to manually upload a new image whenever the QR changed. Dynamic generation is simpler and always up to date.

### addInfo format and diacritics removal

```
RDL - {removeDiacritics(employeeName)} chuyen tien an trua
```

Example: `"Hoàng Đỗ"` → `"RDL - Hoang Do chuyen tien an trua"`

Diacritics are stripped because many Vietnamese bank apps reject transfer descriptions containing Unicode diacritics. The removal uses NFD normalization + combining mark strip + explicit `đ/Đ` replacement (these do not decompose under NFD):

```ts
// src/shared/utils/text.ts
export function removeDiacritics(str: string): string {
  return str
    .normalize("NFD")
    .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, "")
    .replace(/đ/g, "d")
    .replace(/Đ/g, "D")
}
```

### QR debounce

The Finance tab top-up form debounces the amount input 400ms before updating the QR `<img src>`. Without debouncing, every keystroke would fire a new request to VietQR CDN (e.g. typing "150000" = 6 requests; only the last one is needed).

### Bank account config

Admin configures the office bank account once via F4 App Settings. The config is stored in `AppConfig` as three fields: `bankCode` (VietQR BIN), `bankAccount`, `bankAccountName`. These are fetched by the Finance tab on load and passed into `buildVietQRUrl()`.

---

## Vercel Cron

### Schedule

```json
{ "path": "/api/cron/remind-payment", "schedule": "0 6 * * 1-5" }
```

`0 6 * * 1-5` = 06:00 UTC = 13:00 Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh, Monday–Friday only.

### Security

Vercel injects `Authorization: Bearer {CRON_SECRET}` on every cron request. The route handler validates this header before doing any work. Without this, anyone who discovers the URL could trigger the cron manually.

### Idempotency

The cron handler checks for a published menu and employees with negative balance before posting to Slack. Running it twice (e.g. if Vercel retries) would post a duplicate message, but this is acceptable given the low stakes of the reminder.

## Client-Side Data Fetching

### TanStack Query for all server state

All API calls from the browser go through TanStack Query hooks. No `useEffect` + `fetch` patterns.

Benefits:
- Automatic caching and deduplication
- Consistent loading/error states across components
- `invalidateQueries` after mutations keeps the UI in sync
- `refetchInterval` for polling (menu state, order list — every 30s)

### Optimistic updates

Order mutations (place, edit, cancel) use optimistic updates — the UI reflects the change immediately without waiting for the server. On error, TanStack Query rolls back to the previous state automatically.

### Query key factory

All query keys are defined in `src/shared/constants/query-keys.ts`. This prevents typos and makes `invalidateQueries` reliable:

```ts
export const queryKeys = {
  menu: {
    today: () => ["menu", "today"] as const,
    byDate: (date: string) => ["menu", date] as const,
  },
  orders: {
    today: () => ["orders", "today"] as const,
    byEmployee: (employeeId: string, date: string) => ["orders", employeeId, date] as const,
  },
  // ...
}
```

## Payment Design — Ledger System

### Why a ledger instead of `isPaid` on Order

The original design had `isPaid: boolean` + `paidAt: DateTime?` on `Order`. This was replaced with a ledger system for several reasons:

- `isPaid` only tracked whether a specific order was paid — it could not represent the office's actual payment model, where employees top up their balance in advance or in bulk
- There was no way to represent a pre-payment, a partial payment, or an admin correction
- The ledger system (`LedgerEntry`) records every financial event as an immutable entry. Balance = `SUM(amount)` for all entries belonging to an employee
- Admin can correct mistakes via an `adjustment` entry without editing history

### Entry types

| Type | Trigger | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| `topup` | Member self-reports a bank transfer | Positive |
| `order_debit` | Order created (same DB transaction as the Order) | Negative |
| `order_debit` deleted | Order cancelled (same DB transaction) | — |
| `adjustment` | Admin sets a specific target balance | Signed delta |

### Atomic order + debit

Creating or cancelling an Order always writes or removes the corresponding `LedgerEntry` in the same Prisma transaction. It is never valid to have an Order without its `order_debit` entry.

## Why No Separate MenuItem CRUD Was Needed Initially

`MenuItem` records are created automatically when admin types a new dish name in the menu form. The catalog grows organically through daily use without admin ever visiting a management page.

The `/admin/menu-items` page (F8) was added for housekeeping — renaming stale dishes, deactivating ones no longer used. It is not required for the core daily workflow.
